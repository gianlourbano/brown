# Brown

The game engine and the actual game are developed in C++ and built with g++/make. The makefile automatically compiles all of the required code.

## Dependancies

The game is built with the Unix library _ncurses_ and must be compiled with a version greater or equal than 6.

## Compiling

```sh
make
```

while the default executable can be run after compilation with:

```sh
make run
```
